#### Testing NSM library integration ####

## Make NSM wrapper runnable in Docker image both outside and inside the Nitro Enclave ##

The Dockerfile will run the run_integration_tests.py script, which includes loading and initializing the Nitro Secure Module library (libnsm.so).

The NSM library is originally for Rust, and was modified by Luc van Donkersgoed to be compatible with python.
This example uses the compiled NSM library (libnsm.so) from Richard Fan's python example.

The original and most current NSM library is from AWS.

## Steps to build and run the example ##

1. Build the image:

docker build -f container/Dockerfile -t enclave .


2. To run outside the enclave:

docker run enclave

2a. Should print
KMS and keypair created
Nitro gateway created
Onedocker runner service created


3. To run inside the enclave:

nitro-cli build-enclave --docker-uri enclave --output-file enclave.eif
nitro-cli run-enclave --eif-path enclave.eif --memory 4096 --cpu-count 2 --debug-mode

3a. Connect to enclave process

ENCLAVE_ID=$(nitro-cli describe-enclaves | jq -r .[0].EnclaveID)
nitro-cli console --enclave-id $ENCLAVE_ID

3b. Should print
KMS and keypair created
Nitro gateway created
Onedocker runner service created
